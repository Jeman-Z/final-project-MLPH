This dataset provides a thorough evaluation of obesity rates among people in Peru, Mexico, and Colombia who are between the ages of 14 and 61. These individuals exhibit diverse dietary patterns and physical conditions. It includes 17 distinct attributes and a total of 2111 records. The purpose of this data collection is to deepen our understanding of obesity trends within these populations, providing insights that might guide the development of healthcare strategies and personal wellness programs. Data was meticulously collected via an anonymous online survey administered through a web-based platform designed to capture a broad range of dietary and physical activity patterns. The survey inquired about dietary habits, gathering information on Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of alcohol (CALC), Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC), Consumption of food between meals (CAEC), Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), and Consumption of water daily (CH20). Physical condition attributes such as Physical activity frequency (FAF), Calorie consumption monitoring (SCC), Transportation used (MTRANS), and Time using technology devices (TUE) were also assessed. The dataset included demographic data like gender, age, height, and weight; with gender and transportation mode being categorical, and age, height, and weight being continuous variables. It succinctly classified obesity status based on Body Mass Index (BMI), with categories defined as Obesity  (BMI >= 25.0) and not obesity (BMI<=24.9). 

This project tries to predicct the risk of obesity based on dietary habit and pysical activity by developing five predictive models: logistic regression model, random forest model, boosting model, decision tree model and neural network and compared these five models to choose the best one.
